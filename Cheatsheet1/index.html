    <h2>Web Server</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>What is a web server?</strong><br>
            Answer: Web servers are computer systems that host websites.
        </li>
        <li><strong>What does a web server do?</strong><br>

        </li>
        <li><strong>How can content be stored on a web server?</strong><br>
            Answer: Files like HTML files, CSS sheets, images, etc., are stored in the server's file system. When a user requests said files, they are accessed via a URL.

    <ol>
        <li><strong>What is a web client?</strong><br>
            Answer: A web client is software that communicates with web servers to get content from the internet. Mostly, web clients are web browsers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>What does a web client do?</strong><br>
            Answer: It sends requests to web servers and gets/interprets the responses (e.g., in HTML) to display content for the user.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Is a Web Client the same as a Web Browser?</strong><br>
            Answer: A web browser is a type of web client used to display web content on the internet. Not all web clients are web browsers, but all web browsers are web clients.
